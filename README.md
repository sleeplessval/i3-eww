# i3 Workspaces Section for EWW

This project is an i3 state reader built for [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).
I switched my main bar from [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) to EWW,
and this project bridges basic IPC from EWW to i3 (something Polybar did natively).

It emits the i3 workspace state as a single element in EWW's unnecessary and
poorly-documented in-house [Yuck](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/configuration.html)
format.

The workspace numbers emitted will have the `ws-btn` class, `focused` and
`urgent` classes where appropriate, and an `onclick` handler that switches to the
workspace it represents.

The program will also issue commands to EWW to update the `WM_MODE` variable with
the current i3 mode.

## Sample

```yuck

;;	set WM_MODE variable
(defvar WM_MODE "default")

;;	set up listener for i3-sec
(deflisten i3-workspace "/path/to/i3-sec")

;;	basic widget
(defwidget workspace []
	(box
		:space-evenly false
		;;	basic revealer for mode
		(revealer
			:reveal { WM_MODE != "default" }
			:transition "slideleft"
			(label :text WM_MODE)
		)
		;;	workspace content block
		(literal :content i3-workspace)
	)
)

```
